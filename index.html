      <p>C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C Sharp” or “C Hash”. It was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .NET initiative and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO). C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure and the current version of C# is version 7.2. C# is a lot similar to Java syntactically and is easy for users who have knowledge of C, C++, or Java.</p>

    <div id="java">
      <h5>Java</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>The initial name of java was “Oak”. It was changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department changed it to “java” when they found that name was already registered for some computer company.</li>
        <li>Java was made by an accident. Around 1992, James Gosling was working at the Sun Labs. He and his team at that time were building a set-top box and which is started by “cleaning up” the C++ and they all wound up with a new language called Java or Oak.</li>
        <li>Java is the second most popular language and is very popular among the developers.</li>
        <li>Java is free from the concept of Pointer as adding pointers to Java language would compromise security and the robustness, making this language more complex.</li>
        <li>In Java, The meaning of Final keyword is not final. It has different meanings in java. It can be Final class, Final method, Final field or Final variable.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="python">
      <h5>Python</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>There is actually a poem written by Tim Peters named as THE ZEN OF PYTHON which can be read by just writing import this in the interpreter.</li>
        <li>One can return multiple values in Python. Don’t believe ? See the below code snippet:</li>
        <li>One can use an “else” clause with a “for” loop in Python. It’s a special type of syntax that executes only if the for loop exits naturally, without any break statements.</li>
        <li>Function Argument Unpacking is another awesome feature of Python. One can unpack a list or a dictionary as function arguments using * and ** respectively. This is commonly known as the Splat operator.</li>
